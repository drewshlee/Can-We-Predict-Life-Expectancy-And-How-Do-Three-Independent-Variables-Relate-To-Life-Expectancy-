## Background

In 1948, the World Health Organization was established to develop and maintain stringent public health standards across the world. In doing so, the WHO has determined that life expectancy is one of the most important measures of the overall health of community. Thus, for the WHO, life expectancy is not only an important health indicator that brings in profits and donations (shows that the WHO is doing its job), but also an indicator that shows that the WHO is doing their job in promoting and developing public health worldwide. 

With the aforementioned in mind, I wanted to investigate life expectancy under the lens of three independent variables that, without any analysis, would seem to affect life expectancy: GDP per Capita, Population, and Schooling. 

GDP per capita is the amount of output per person (simplified), and is typically an indicator of economic success, which usually leads to greater public health standards, and subsequently, life expectancy

With population size, I wanted to investigate this variable because a larger population size may either lead to greater public health standards (because of the sheer amount of people and great minds) and life expectancy, or may shorten life expectancy because of overpopulation and the rapid spread of disease. 

And lastly, education has always been a subject of hotly contested debate in regard to life expectancy. Some researchers claim that life expectancy is determined by money and social mobility, while others, and popular media/the WHO, claim that [education is of particular importance in regard to life expectancy](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2166833-more-education-is-what-makes-people-live-longer-not-more-money/)

To investigate these the relationships among these three variables and life expectancy, I took a look at [WHO Life Expectancy Data through Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
